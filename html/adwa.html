    <h1>WHAT IS ADWA TOUR</h1>
    <p>Among the few events that have brought Ethiopia to the attention of the world, none are as significant as the victory at Adwa. The outcome of the battle led the country to achieve special importance in the eyes of people all over the world, especially those living under colonialism. The credit for the victory goes to more than 100,000 Ethiopians who set aside their differences to defend their country from a foreign enemy.
         Under the leadership of Emperor Menelik II, they marched to Adwa town located about1,000 kilometres from the capital, Addis Ababa. <br>

        The call for total mobilization came on September 17, 1895. Following the announcement, men and women from all corners of the country travelled for two months to reach Adwa.<br>  They crossed rugged mountains and roads on foot to humiliate the superior Italian army on March 2, 1896.
        
        The significance of the victory and the sacrifices made by those brave men and women has gradually diminished in the eyes of successive generations. <br> Though the day is still celebrated as a national holiday, the struggle that culminated with the Battle of Adwa, the moment in history that led to the foundation of modern Ethiopia, and the values for which the heroes of that battle sacrificed their lives, is, in the current political climate, fading from the minds of the general public.
        
        Instead of celebrating this day like any other public holiday, some Ethiopians are trying to remind their fellow citizens of the true meaning of Adwa, and its legacy. The lessons from this battle and the victory are pertinent to the major social, political and economic problems Ethiopians are now facing. Yared Shumete, renowned filmmaker, is one of the organizers of Guzo Adwa, literally translated as ‘Journey to Adwa’.
        
        Guzo Adwa began five years ago, and allows people to commemorate the Battle of Adwa by taking, on foot, the 1,000 kilometre journey from Addis Ababa to Adwa town.</p>

    <h2>Guzo Adwa Creating a Historical Awakening</h2>
   
    <p>The victory at Adwa is an important achievement that represents Ethiopian unity. <br>
         However, the virtues that historic battle — unity, freedom, equality and justice — seem to be eroding. <br>
          Guzo Adwa is trying to reinvigorate the Ethiopian public through an annual journey to the battle site. <br>
           EBR’s adjunct writer, Meseret Mamo explores how the annual trip inspires Ethiopian youth to learn from <br>
            the heroes of Adwa.</p>
          <h2>Significance

       <p>The call for total mobilization came on September 17, 1895. Following the announcement, men and women <br>

          roads on foot to humiliate the superior Italian army on March 2, 1896. <br>
